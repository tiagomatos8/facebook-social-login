This project is a example of how to build a social login with facebook using React JS.

In the App.js file you can see inside the lifecycle method componentDidMount the calls to the Facebook SDK.

https://tiagomatos8.github.io/facebook-social-login/ This link is not working at the moment because the config for my app in developer.facebook.com alow only one domain per app. At the moment I'm testing with localhost, once I'm done with everythig I'll change the domain to tiagomatos8.github.io
